## Introduction

The goal of this project is to create a classifier that can distinguish between images of cats and dogs. This is a common problem in computer vision and serves as a good introduction to image classification using deep learning.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the popular [Kaggle Dogs vs. Cats dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data). It contains 25,000 images of dogs and cats (12,500 from each class) for training, and 12,500 images for testing.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. Additionally, install the necessary packages by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Raha111/Cat_vs_dog-using-CNN.git
